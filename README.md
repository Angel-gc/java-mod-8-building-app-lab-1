# Application Building Lab 1

## Instructions

Following the same process we did for Level 1 and Level 2 components, add all
the components into their target location using their respective selection. A
couple of things to remember:

1. Use Bootstrap-based layout to position the component where it should be in
   its parent component
2. When a component is inside another `container` `div`, its "100%" or "12
   columns" of layout are inside that container's space
3. Use the Bootstrap's column layout to position the sender's messages to the
   left of the conversation history panel and to position the user's messages to
   the right of the conversation history panel

You should end up with an application that looks like this:

Take some time to do this on your own. We'll include the solution here, as we
will be building on it as we progress in this section.
